                            <p>song tells the story of the cyber girl Ene, living inside the computer of the NEET Shintaro. He refuses to do anything but stay in his room and use his computer, and Ene watches him go through his days with only minor changes in routine. He averts his eyes from the real world and hides, even though he cannot forget his own past. She reminds him that he should know that fleeing from reality is not the best solution, but that if he has to, he should live with her in a world created by humans, and pay attention only to her. At the end of the song, Shintaro tells her that he's tired of "a toy that can only talk".<br /></p> 
                            <p>As revealed in Lost Time Memory, this song takes place in the Route XX timeline, where Shintaro fails to meet the Mekakushi Dan and kills both Ene and himself.</p>

However, one only gets to enter the hideout of the gang with a password. The group completes missions, some of which are dangerous, and recruits new members.</p>

                            <p>Kagerou Daze was uploaded on September 30, 2011, and quickly gained views, becoming Jin's most popular song, and in turn the most popular song in the series. It has reached over 6,000,000 views on Nico Nico Douga. It also gave the Project its name.<br /></p>
                            <p>The story behind the song revolves around a boy, Hibiya, and a girl, Hiyori. On August 15th, the two of them are spending time together in a park. Hiyori has a cat on her lap, when all of a sudden the cat runs away and the girl tries to get it back. Hibiya witnesses Hiyori running out into the street to retrieve the black cat and getting hit by a truck. The heat apparently mocks him in his daze, and he blacks out. Following, he wakes up on August 14th and goes to meet Hiyori again, where he tells her about his strange dream that took place in the park they were walking in. Hibiya suggests that they go home together, but just as Hiyori steps in front of him, a pole falls from the sky and pierces through her. The heat once again laughs at him. Before he blacks out, he notices Hiyori seeming to be smiling as she dies.<br /></p>
                            <p>This process repeats for decades, the same two days happening over and over. Finally, Hibiya decides to take action and pushes Hiyori out of the way of the truck, so that he is killed himself, thinking it would stop the loop from repeating. In the end, it shows Hiyori was also caught in the loop. It turns out that she had been trying to save Hibiya from death as well, so the cycle still continues on</p>

                            <p>This song tells the story about a dream Takane Enomoto has. On an average day in summer, she finds herself extremely bored, so she turns on the radio to hear the voice of the country's president, announcing that the world is going to end today. She had a half finished game with no save and a textbook. Scared, she put her headphones on, trying to stop her body from trembling. Listening to an unknown song, by an unknown artist, a voice from her headphones suddenly asks her if she wants to survive. She soon realizes the voice is her own. It tells her to go 20 minutes ahead and cross a hill, better or worse she would find out what it means.<br /></p>
                            <p>On her way she crosses a crowded intersection. Her voice tells her that 12 minutes are left. Takane believes if everything is going to vanish, she has no other choice but to listen to the voice from the headphones. Many minutes pass as she runs with tears in her eyes, having only one minute left. Eventually, she can no longer hear the voice because the hill that she is supposed to cross is right in front of her. When she gets to her destination, a group of scientists congratulate her. She finds out her town was an experiment that was no longer needed, so one of the scientists calmly detonates a bomb. The girl is told she was living her whole entire life in a box. As she looks at her town, all she can see is a burnt wreckage. From her headphones she hears a faint "Sorry" and the video shows an outline of Ene.</p>

                                <p>This song has also received a million views on Nico Nico Douga, and is the first IA song to do so. It is also known as 空想フォレスト/Kuusou Forest (Fantasy Forest) or Imaginary Forest. Jin later decided to officially call it "Fantasy Forest" instead of "Imagination Forest", but it's still most commonly known by its previous name. The song summarizes Marry's life before she became a member of the Mekakushi Dan.<br /></p>
                                <p>Marry Kozakura is a 3/4 human, 1/4 medusa girl who is living all by herself in a house in a forest. She believes that the world is simple, but that she is too different to be a part of it. She tries to convince herself that her house, which is not easily noticed, is the reason no one comes to visit. With a hard heart she resigns to loneliness. Since she is isolated from society, everything Marry knows comes from the books she reads. She longs for the real world and asks for forgiveness for doing so. She imagines a wild future, and wishes for said future to knock on her door. Lost in her daydream about experiencing the world, she suddenly hears a voice. In a panic, she spills her tea and does not know what to do.<br /></p>
                                <p>In the next scene, Marry's past is shown again, where her mother tells her not to look into anyone's eyes or they will turn to stone. This brings light to the fact that she is part medusa. Wanting to know more about what she is, she looks into her books and reads a story about the Medusa, realizing that creatures like her are feared. She is upset that she was born this way and throws both, the book and a mirror she was holding, to the floor.<br /></p>
                                <p>Back to the present, Marry hears the owner of the previously mentioned voice knocking at the door, which has never happened before. She continues to panic and tries to pretend she did not hear the knock, then trips over a book, and the person opens the door.<br /></p>
                                <p>Another flashback shows a five-year-old Marry, playing outside and making flower crowns, while her mother, Shion, is inside the house organizing books. Unfortunately, two humans come and try to kidnap Marry, pulling at her hair and harming her body. Shion runs to save her, but one of the humans grabs her leg and trips her up. To protect her daughter, Shion tries to turn the humans into stone, but is hit on the head with a wooden object and dies from the impact.<br /></p>
                                <p>Back to the present, Marry hides under a table and covers her eyes. The boy at the door is surprised by her actions. Marry tells him that if he looks into her eyes he will turn to stone, and the boy, not knowing that she is a medusa, takes it the wrong way, as her warning did not specify that he would be turned to stone, so he thinks Marry is talking about herself. He thinks that she is afraid of other people and tells her that he was scared too, then asks if she thinks the world would be better without that fear. The boy puts headphones into Marry's ears and plays music from his phone, which sparks her imagination. The boy puts his hood over her head and gives it to her as a gift.<br /></p>
                                <p>In the last scene Marry is seen looking up at her house as the wind blows against her hood, which is now decorated by simple red roses along the edges. She turns around and smiles at Kido and the boy, of whom is revealed to be Seto.</p>

                            <p>song has also received a million views on Nico Nico Douga, and is the first IA song to do so. It is also known as 空想フォレスト/Kuusou Forest (Fantasy Forest) or Imaginary Forest. Jin later decided to officially call it "Fantasy Forest" instead of "Imagination Forest", but it's still most commonly known by its previous name. The song summarizes Marry's life before she became a member of the Mekakushi Dan.<br /></p>
                            <p>Marry Kozakura is a 3/4 human, 1/4 medusa girl who is living all by herself in a house in a forest. She believes that the world is simple, but that she is too different to be a part of it. She tries to convince herself that her house, which is not easily noticed, is the reason no one comes to visit. With a hard heart she resigns to loneliness. Since she is isolated from society, everything Marry knows comes from the books she reads. She longs for the real world and asks for forgiveness for doing so. She imagines a wild future, and wishes for said future to knock on her door. Lost in her daydream about experiencing the world, she suddenly hears a voice. In a panic, she spills her tea and does not know what to do.<br /></p>
                            <p>In the next scene, Marry's past is shown again, where her mother tells her not to look into anyone's eyes or they will turn to stone. This brings light to the fact that she is part medusa. Wanting to know more about what she is, she looks into her books and reads a story about the Medusa, realizing that creatures like her are feared. She is upset that she was born this way and throws both, the book and a mirror she was holding, to the floor.<br /></p>
                            <p>Back to the present, Marry hears the owner of the previously mentioned voice knocking at the door, which has never happened before. She continues to panic and tries to pretend she did not hear the knock, then trips over a book, and the person opens the door.<br /></p>
                            <p>Another flashback shows a five-year-old Marry, playing outside and making flower crowns, while her mother, Shion, is inside the house organizing books. Unfortunately, two humans come and try to kidnap Marry, pulling at her hair and harming her body. Shion runs to save her, but one of the humans grabs her leg and trips her up. To protect her daughter, Shion tries to turn the humans into stone, but is hit on the head with a wooden object and dies from the impact.<br /></p>
                            <p>Back to the present, Marry hides under a table and covers her eyes. The boy at the door is surprised by her actions. Marry tells him that if he looks into her eyes he will turn to stone, and the boy, not knowing that she is a medusa, takes it the wrong way, as her warning did not specify that he would be turned to stone, so he thinks Marry is talking about herself. He thinks that she is afraid of other people and tells her that he was scared too, then asks if she thinks the world would be better without that fear. The boy puts headphones into Marry's ears and plays music from his phone, which sparks her imagination. The boy puts his hood over her head and gives it to her as a gift.<br /></p>
                            <p>In the last scene Marry is seen looking up at her house as the wind blows against her hood, which is now decorated by simple red roses along the edges. She turns around and smiles at Kido and the boy, of whom is revealed to be Seto.</p>

                            <p>This song was uploaded on May 25th, 2012, and has reached over 3,000,000 views. It quickly became popular after its PV release and reached the Vocaloid Hall of Fame within one day.<br /></p>
                            <p>Momo Kisaragi, a young girl who is also a pretty popular idol, is going out for a walk, but tries to not gather too much attention today. She dons a hoodie to hide her face from the public and hopes that no one recognizes her. Though she makes her way through back alleys and stays careful, she still gets spotted and her hood blows off as a strong wind comes by, making people notice her immediately. As the crowd starts to take photos she runs away, as she is sick of her idol life by now.<br /></p>
                            <p>She jumps over a fence and sees several posters of herself, making her nervous. Momo states she would like to tell everyone to not stare at her anymore, but she keeps it to herself and continues to run. Finally feeling safe, she drinks a soda and thinks about when it started that she got so much attention from people. As she can't really remember, and continues her walking, but hides behind a wall as she notices everyone is in panic, making her want to quit her idol job.<br /></p>
                            <p>The video then shows a short scene of how she signed the contract to become an idol, then switches back to present. Looking at a poster of herself she wonders if she really deserves all this attention and doesn't understand it at all. She starts to cry and continues to do so until suddenly she notices a girl with green hair in front of her. The girl brings her to the hideout of the Mekakushi Dan where she gets introduced to Kido, Kano and Marry (later Seto as well). After some trouble with a misunderstanding they ask her to join the group and she agrees, when suddenly Marry trips and spills tea over Momo. She takes it with humor and they become friends.<br /></p>
                            <p>The next scene skips to a concert of Momo, showing how she looks at a photo of her new friends on her cell phone with a smile. Being encouraged by the help of her friends she faces her idol life with a more positive mindset and accepts her eye power, which she now uses to attract even more attention during her performance. Knowing the other members of the Mekakushi Dan are watching, she takes her hoodie and puts it on her shoulders. The last scene shows how Momo is out again, then also shows her brother Shintaro for a short moment, referencing the following scenes in the manga.</p>

                            <p>Lost Time Memory features the Shintaro of two different story routes; One who is able to accept that Ayano has died, and one who is unable to, who is shown during scenes of Route XX.<br /></p>
                            <p>The PV starts off with Ayano and Shintaro walking down a bridge and him telling her to leave him alone. Ayano, however, refuses to leave his side, so he calls her annoying, then walks ahead of her.<br /></p>
                            <p>Following, Shintaro is seen in his room, the time and date being August 15, 12:33. He decides to go outside, bringing Ene along with him. Wishing to die already, he clutches his wrist, and steps in front of a door with the numbers 107 on it. The door is opened and in front of him the other members of the Mekakushi Dan appear. He greets all of them, shortly after hearing Ayano's voice, which suggests to "play" once more.<br /></p>
                            <p>The events of Route XX begin with Ene stating she is worried. Shintaro starts to wander all about his room and finally drifts to sleep. He dreams about Ayano and him in their middle school years, until he hears Ene's voice asking if that means he cannot even see tomorrow. Promptly, he opens his eyes and turns to strangle Ene, who disappears from his grip, seemingly having died. Shintaro suffers a nervous breakdown and takes out a pair of scissors.<br /></p>
                            <p>Another scene from Route XX begins to play, proceeding from when the Snake of Clearing Eyes takes over the body of Konoha, therefore turning into 'Black Konoha', in order to kill the Mekakushi Dan and repeat the tragedy they are part of.<br /></p>
                            <p>Route XX Shintaro sits on his bed and stabs himself with the red scissors, while in the parallel scene, Black Konoha attempts to shoot himself with a gun. However, Shintaro takes the shot, causing himself to die differently in both scenes.<br /></p>
                            <p>The next scene shows Route XX Shintaro and the other Shintaro lying on the ground, surrounded by a white nothingness. Route XX Shintaro sits down, with Azami looking down at him, until the other Shintaro walks past her, much to the gorgon's surprise. Route XX Shintaro and him appear to be in an empty classroom, back to back. Ayano stands in front of Route XX Shintaro and apologizes for dying, whereupon she asks if they should say their farewells to each other. Shintaro runs after her, begging her to stay, again expressing that the Shintaro of this route has not yet accepted her death. The other Shintaro walks forward and smiles at a surprised Ayano, who smiles back at him. She then wraps her scarf around her friend, whose eyes turn red, proving he has accepted Ayano and gained an eye ability.<br /></p>
                            <p>At the end, Route XX Shintaro is seen lying down on his bed, the date and time being August 15, 12:32.</p>

                            <p>This song tells the story of Ayano's past. It starts off when Kido, Seto, and Kano are introduced to Ayano by her mother. They believe that they are monsters due to their red eyes, but Ayano cheers them up by saying that red is the color of heroes. Following, she shows them a picture book of a hero story while wearing a red muffler.<br /></p>
                            <p>Soon Ayano's mother dies due to an accident. Ayano tells herself that she has to be a good big sister and cheer her siblings up. One day she sees her dad planning an experiment on her friends, Takane and Haruka. Devastated by this, she tries to save them by committing suicide, thus entering the Heat Haze.</p>

                            <p>After posted by Jin, this video quickly became the 1st in the Nico Nico Douga ranking.<br /></p>
                            <p>The scenes take place after the events described in Kagerou Days. Hibiya, who is depressed after losing his friend and crush Hiyori, is trying to live with the fact, but is unable to do so. Momo tries her best to cheer him up by showing him stuff in life that are worth to move on for. By doing this he slowly lightens up, but as soon as Momo steps on a cat's tail, Hibiya is haunted by the memories of Hiyori, who liked to pet cats as well, falling back into depression.<br /></p>
                            <p>After several attempts to cheer Hibiya up with food and fun, they eventually end up in the park together. Walking by a playground he once again remembers Hiyori's death by getting pierced by falling iron poles and can no longer hold back his tears, crying out that he misses her. Desperate as she is, Momo grabs the boy and activates her power to show up him he is not alone, encouraging him to accept his eye power and past and no longer hold onto his grief.<br /></p>
                            <p>As she later wakes up on Kido's lap, having passed out from exhaustion, she notices Hibiya shouting at the moon while his eyes turn red that he will give his happiness another chance. Seeing Momo that happy over his emotional change, he holds out his hand to hold hers, but hesitates. Seeing this Momo grabs his hand and pulls him along with her, all while being watched by her brother Shintaro.</p>

Because this is more like a story of recalling the past tragedy, so it's actually quite saddening. The main character of the story will be Enomoto Takane, who later became Ene, and also (?) Konoha and Kenjirou-sensei. You'll have to wait for a while for the song to release. According to the plan, it'll be the 1st PV to meet you guys in the 2nd album.</p>

                            <p>Outer Science features the end of the "Bad End" route, also known as Route XX. It takes places after the goal to combine the snakes and create a new medusa in the real world is prevented by Ayano Tateyama, who gained a snake but did not leave the Heat Haze again. The Snake of Clearing Eyes possesses Konoha, turning into Black Konoha, planning to kill those who received a snake and force Marry Kozakura to reset the timeline.<br /></p>
                            <p>The snake is seen in the body of Dark Konoha, together with Azami, its former "master", who is powerless to do anything against the snake, due to the loss of her power to combine the snakes and take back the order for the Heat Haze to bring in anyone who died on August 15.<br /></p>
                            <p>It proceeds to ridicule her, Marry, and Kenjirou, his "next master", for their foolish wish to keep living with the ones dear to them. Realizing the situation, Marry starts to cry and to wonder why the deaths of her friends have to repeat all over again. Once more, the snake makes fun of Azami for how the story of her life went, and that she even carelessly allowed herself to fall in love, causing the snake to laugh out loud.<br /></p>
                            <p>Being obsessed with the thought of following its master's wish and creating a new medusa in the real world with the power of the snakes, the snake addresses Marry once more, rhetorically asking her about her power of Combining Eyes, which allows her to combine all the snakes and control the Heat Haze, a power her grandmother gave her via the Queen Snake in order to save her life.<br /></p>
                            <p>The snake approaches the Mekakushi Dan while possessing the body of Konoha, taking one life after another, until only Marry is left. Kenjirou as well is seen dead on the floor in front of the snake. Not wanting to live in a world without her friends, Marry gives in to the snake's deliberate provocations and uses the power of Combining Eyes to reset the timeline, causing another route of the story to start.</p>

                            <h4>Background</h4>
                            <p>Ayano has just found out that Snake of Clearing Eyes is planning to sacrifice her and her friends and siblings to revive their dead mother under their father's wish. Vowing to never let this happen she decides to commit suicide and enter the Heat Haze, and prevent the final piece needed to complete the plan, The Snake of Favoring Eyes, from manifesting the real world in hopes of not hurting her friends and siblings<br /></p>
                            <p>Ayano is falling with her life flashing before her eyes. She knows suicide will only bring her misery, but she is too afraid to pursue her own happiness and sacrifice everyone she cares about. She ponders upon all of her regrets, and how much it pains her to kill her own emotions and deny her own love for Shintaro, but vows to erase this truth, and "delete herself from the story."<br /></p>
                            <p>Ayano is then trapped in the Heat Haze sitting alone watching events transpiring in the real world. She realizes she can't go home anymore and starts to question whether she made the wrong decision, her days are filled with emptiness, crying, and possibly regret.<br /></p>
                            <p>The world is reset after Marry had reset the timeline, and Ayano finds out that she played right into the snake possessing her father's plan. The snake can only exist by possessing people and fulfilling their desires, so if Ayano's mother was to revive it would cease to exist. So he manipulated events so that this couldn't come to pass, forcing him to reset the timeline to try (and fail) again, thus being able to live forever in this repeating time loop.<br /></p>
                            <p>Finally coming to terms with having failed her original mission and having trapped herself in the Heat Haze, she nonetheless vows to fight on by watching all the gruesome events transpiring and "write this story." Thus were she ever to escape she could tell all that had happened and help her friends breakout of the time loop, but instead has to hope that the snake will not come with another plan to reset the timeloop once again, and will not try to hurt her friends and siblings to bring the snakes to the real world.<br /></p>
                            <p>Her unrealized love for Shintaro was what kept her going and sane throughout all the time loops, and that no matter how hard she tried she could never kill her own emotions, still staying optimistic and happy. She vows to return, save everyone and confess to Shintaro, one day.</p>
